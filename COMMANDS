Inter VLAN Routing :

multiple broadcast domains, Routers or layer 3 switches are used for intercommunication between the different VLANs.The process of intercommunication of the different Vlans is known as Inter Vlan Routing (IVR).
•	 Inter VLAN Routing can be achieved through a layer-3 device i.e. Router or layer-3 Switch.
•	 Why use L3 SWITCH because the layer 3 switch provides both management and routing services.
L3 SWITCH  advantages –
1.	Speed: Inter-VLAN routing by Layer 3 switch is faster than other methods, as the Layer 3 switch can perform the routing process quickly, without requiring the intervention of an external router.
2.	Cost-effective: Using a Layer 3 switch for inter-VLAN routing can be more cost-effective than using a separate router, as it eliminates the need for an external router and its associated costs.
3.	Scalability: Inter-VLAN routing by Layer 3 switch is scalable, as additional VLANs can be added easily without significant changes to the network topology.
4.	Security: Inter-VLAN routing by Layer 3 switch provides better security than other methods, as it allows for the creation of access control lists (ACLs) to restrict traffic between VLANs.

•	Process-  first the packet is delivered to the layer 3 switch and then to the destination 
1.	Take L3 switch and 4 PC’s and connect with the help of automatic cable.
2.	Then configure all PC’s as per your network.
3.	Click on switch (CLI) and create the VLAN’s as per your network(how many VLAN’s/networks you want).
4.	Then set the range of PC’s as per your VLAN’s.
5.	After this process IP ROUTING process will be start .on the switch continue this process 
Creating vlan’s-

Commands- on switch for IP ROUTING 
Ip routing
Int vlan 2(number of vlan)
Ip add 192.168.10.1  255.255.255.0
No shut
Ex.
Int vlan 3(number of vlan)
Ip add 192.168.11.1  255.255.255.0
No shut
Ex.

Same command as per you creating your VLANs/networks and run it
